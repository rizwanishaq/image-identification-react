This demo made just to practice tensorflow js and reactjs, all the code is taken from the [Thought Span](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Lg1bVbqY4&list=LL&index=3&ab_channel=ThoughtSpan), and updated, with create and use context just for practicing purposes. Thanks [Thought Span](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9NiNxOO-Xi6UgCjbnIjSoQ) for such a nice tutorial.
